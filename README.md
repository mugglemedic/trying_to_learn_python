# trying_to_learn_python

I switched my major to computer science. My first class is intro to python in March. 
Lets see how this goes.

I would like input if you have any. Be gentile and constructive. 
I have no coding experience except visual basic in high school 20 years ago. 
I am currently a paramedic. 
Also, I'm intending on using this as a way to learn how to better navigate and utilize github.


I started this python journey 28 Jan, 2026.
