# trying_to_learn_python
I switched my major to computer science. My first class is intro to python. Lets see how this goes.

I would like input if you have any. Be gentile and constructive. 
I have no coding experience except visual basic in high school 20 years ago. 
I am currently a paramedic. 

I started this python journey 28 Jan, 2026.
